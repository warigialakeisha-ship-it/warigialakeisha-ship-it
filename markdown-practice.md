##My learning goals


###This semester


This semester, my goal is to build a **strong foundation** in *Arttificial Intelligence* and **programming**. I want to improve my *coding skills*, build AI systems, and learn how to use `Github` for collaboration. By the end of the semester,i hope to be more confident in solving problems and creating `useful projects` ~~without fear~~.
